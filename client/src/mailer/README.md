## API Integration

All components use the centralized API utility (`utils/api.js`) for backend communication:

```javascript
import { emailAPI, customerAPI } from '../utils/api';

// Enhance email content
const enhanced = await emailAPI.enhanceMessage({
  description,
  subject
});

// Get customers
const customers = await customerAPI.getCustomers();

// Send email
await emailAPI.sendEmail({
  subject,
  message,
  recipients
});
```

## Backend Endpoints Needed

You'll need to implement these backend routes:

```
POST /api/email/enhance     - Enhance email content with AI
POST /api/email/send        - Send email immediately  
POST /api/email/schedule    - Schedule email for later
GET  /api/customers         - Get customer list
GET  /api/customers/segments - Get customer segments
```

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update `VITE_API_URL` to your backend URL
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server

## Usage

```jsx
import MailingDashboard from './components/MailingDashboard';

function App() {
  return <MailingDashboard />;
}
```

## Error Handling

- API call failures show user-friendly messages
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Loading states provide user feedback
- Fallback to mock data when API unavailable

## Mock Data

Components include mock customer data for development/testing when backend isn't ready.

## Customization

- Update colors by modifying Tailwind classes
- Change API endpoints in `utils/api.js`
- Modify mock data in `CustomerList.jsx`
- Adjust email preview styling in `EmailPreview.jsx`
